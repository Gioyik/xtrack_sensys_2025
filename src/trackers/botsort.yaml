# Default Ultralytics settings for BoT-SORT tracker when using mode="track"
# For documentation and examples see https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/track/
# For BoT-SORT source code see https://github.com/NirAharon/BoT-SORT

tracker_type: botsort # tracker type, ['botsort', 'bytetrack']
# NOTE: Change 2: Make the first association more lenient, allowing dections
# to match existing tracks more easily. Default: 0.25
track_high_thresh: 0.2 # threshold for the first association
track_low_thresh: 0.1 # threshold for the second association
# NOTE: Change 3: Make it harder to create new tracks, reducing
# false new IDs for existing (detected) people. Default: 0.25
new_track_thresh: 0.5 # threshold for init new track if the detection does not match any tracks
# NOTE: Change 1: Keep "lost" tracks alive longer, preventing new IDs from
# being assigned when a person briefly disappears. Default: 30
# track_buffer: 150 #  = 5 s (30fps)
track_buffer: 90 #  = 3 s (30fps)
# NOTE: Change 4: Make it easier for the tracker to associate the same person
# across frames (especially after occulsion). Default: 0.8
match_thresh: 0.4 # threshold for matching tracks
fuse_score: True # Whether to fuse confidence scores with the iou distances before matching
# min_box_area: 10  # threshold for min box areas(for tracker evaluation, not used for now)

# BoT-SORT settings
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow # method of global motion compensation
# ReID model related thresh
proximity_thresh: 0.5 # minimum IoU for valid match with ReID
# NOTE: Change 5: Makes appearance matching more lenient,
# helping maintain IDs. Default: 0.8
appearance_thresh: 0.8 # minimum appearance similarity for ReID
with_reid: True # indicates whether to use ReID
model: auto # uses native features if detector is YOLO else yolo11n-cls.pt
